# kettolab-todo-cli

A simple CLI Todo app written in Rust.

This repository is part of the **kettolab** series â€” an experimental playground for building simple, functional tools and applications through hands-on learning.

This project is intended to help improve development skills by implementing and iterating on small ideas, starting with a command-line todo manager.
